		<h1>Bellarmine Club Day App</h1>

		<p>
		<strong>What is this app?</strong><br>
		This app lets you collect names of people interested in your Bellarmine club during club day. In past years, students would write their email addresses down on papers and club leaders would have to manually enter these addresses to generate rosters. In this app, students just have to enter their student IDs to be added to the club rosters.

		<br><br>

		<strong>How do I set it up?</strong><br>
		Turn off Auto-Lock in your general iOS settings. Then, go to the first tab in this app and enter your club ID (should be in your email account, if you don't have it email Chanan Walia (Chanan.Walia16@bcp.org). Then go to the second tab and leave it open on your club's table.

		<br><br>

		<strong>How can students sign up for my club?</strong><br>
		Make sure you are on the second tab. Students may enter their Bellarmine student IDs. Once entered, the app will ask to confirm the students name. When the students hits "That's Me!", he will be added to your club's roster.

		<br><br>

		<strong>How do I view my roster and email my club members?</strong><br>
		Make sure you go to the third tab and sync with the server after club day ends. We will have a convenient web application that will let you easily view your club roster and email your club members. We will be contacting club leaders shortly after club day with access instructions.

		<br><br>

		<strong>What if my iPad stops working or runs out of battery?</strong><br>
		No problem. Open this app on a friend's iPad, enter your club code, and continue collecting student IDs. Make sure to go to the third tab and sync to the server on both your friend's iPad and your iPad shortly after club day. If you don't have access to a backup iPad, take down student IDs on paper, and, on the web application we release after club day, you'll be able to manually enter those IDs and the corresponding names and emails will be added to your roster automatically.

		<strong>What if I need support after club day?</strong><br>
